From order of difficulty:
1. CalculatorConsole - This program demonstrates a simple command line calculator. It will ask the user
//      to enter two numbers and an operator. It will then perform the operation and 
//      display the result.
2. RockPaperScissors - This program demonstrates a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The program allows the user
//      to play the game until they choose to quit. The program will then display the results. 
3. BasicBank - This program demonstrates a simple bank program using basic functions. The program allows 
//      the user to view their account balance, deposit money, and withdraw money. The program 
//      continues to run until the user chooses to quit.
4. Supermarket - This program demonstrates a simple supermarket management system. The program allows
//      the user to add, modify, and delete products, view the list of products, and generate a 
//      receipt.
5. BugTracker - This program demonstrates a simple Bug Tracker. It allows the user to add, view, search, 
//      update, and delete bugs. The program continues to run until the user chooses to quit. 

Next possible steps for improvement:
1. Adding UI to the Supermarket and BugTracker programmes e.g. Qt, wxWidgets, SFML
2. Creating a database/storage option for the Supermarket and BugTracker programmes e.g. SQLite
